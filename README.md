Hospital Management System Demo Overview
Problem Statement
Hospitals often struggle with disorganized data—patient records, medical imaging (e.g., MRIs), medication details, financial records, and outpatient management are all scattered. This leads to inefficiencies and poor patient care.

Our Solution
We’ve built a streamlined system using Zoho CRM to centralize and manage all critical hospital operations via a simple, user-friendly interface.

Key Features & Workflow
Patient Registration & Lead Creation

Patients fill out a digital appointment form.

Submitting this form automatically generates a lead in Zoho CRM.

Appointment Scheduling & Doctor Assignment

Appointments can be tracked easily within the CRM.

Doctors are managed through a Doctor Module, where you add and view doctor profiles and availability.

Once a doctor is assigned, automated email notifications are sent to both the patient and doctor with appointment details.

Medical Data Capture

For each patient, you can log:

Prescriptions (e.g., medications like “Paracetamol 650”)

Lab test results

Imaging files and reports (e.g., MRIs)

Treatment Completion & Notes

After treatment concludes, the status is updated to “Completed.”

You can add discharge summaries or final notes.

Financial Tracking

Every patient’s expenses are logged, including treatment charges, reimbursements, and other related costs.

Expense data is automatically linked to the patient’s profile.

Form Management & Data Storage

Custom forms collect and organize diverse data.

Everything is stored in a centralized Data Hub module.

Impact & Benefits
Centralized patient and operational data

Automated lead generation and appointment workflows

Seamless tracking of medical and financial information

Enhanced communication between patients, doctors, and administrative staff

This platform is ideal for government hospitals aiming to modernize their data management and improve service efficiency.
